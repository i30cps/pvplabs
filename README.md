# PvPLabs

**PvPLabs** is an open-source Minecraft plugin built for the PvPLabs server. Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/txGzD5RKGF) to join the community!  

It is designed to provide a more accurate, transparent, and competitive alternative to the widely used but flawed ranked system of MCTiers.  
In addition to a fully reworked ranked system, PvPLabs aims to evolve into a full-featured PvP **minigame server framework**.

## 🎯 Goals

- Replace the flawed ranking model used by MCTiers  
- Create a fair and mathematically sound rating system that is more accessible to more players (no testing queue)  
- Expand into a structured PvP minigame server  
- Keep everything open-source and community-driven
- The **PvPLabs** server may also implement additional cheater-resistant measures not found on other servers.

## 🧠 Why?

While MCTiers (and PvPTiers) are both very widely used ranked PvP systems, they exhibit many issues:

- Poor competitive integrity (cheating and boosting that makes the system significantly worse; and two highly strange occurances of a failure to maintain competitive integrity)  
- Poor transparency from the highest staff members  
- A poor lower rank testing system that slows all players from entering the competitive scene  
- Inconsistent skill rankings  

We are building PvPLabs with the goals of increasing transparency and maintaining integrity, along with providing a different way of measuring skill because of the issues with the traditional testing system
